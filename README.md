# Homework 1 & 2

Elia Mirafiori VR537643

## Instructions

To run this project you can either run it via the Jupyter Notebook or using directly the source code.

### Source Code

In order to run this project on your PC, you have to install the required 3rd party libraries that you can find in the `requirements.txt` file.

I highly suggest to create a Virtual Envirovment, to do so go to the root folder of this project and run:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Then to activate the Virtual Envirovment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Now you can install the packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Finally, you can run the project by using:

```bash
python3 -m src.VR537643
```
