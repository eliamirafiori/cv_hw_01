## Instructions

To run this project you can either run it via the Jupyter Notebook or using directly the source code.

In order to run this project on your PC, you have to install the required 3rd party libraries that you can find in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Virtual Envirovment

I highly suggest to create a Virtual Envirovment, to do so go to the root folder of this project and run:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Then to activate the Virtual Envirovment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Now you can install the packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Jupyter Notebook

If you plan to use the Jupyter notebook you need to select the proper Kernel in the Top-Right corner. Choose the one you just create with the packages installed.

### Source Code

Finally, you can run the project by using:

```bash
python3 -m src.VR537643
```
